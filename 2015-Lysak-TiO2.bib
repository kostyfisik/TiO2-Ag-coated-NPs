abstract  ="The interaction strength of Au nanoparticles with pristine and nitrogen doped TiO2 nanowire surfaces was analysed using density functional theory and their significance in enhancing the solar driven photoelectrocatalytic properties was elucidated. In this article{,} we prepared 4-dimethylaminopyridine capped Au nanoparticle decorated TiO2 nanowire systems. The density functional theory calculations show {101} facets of TiO2 as the preferred phase for dimethylaminopyridine-Au nanoparticles anchoring with a binding energy of -8.282 kcal mol-1. Besides{,} the interaction strength of Au nanoparticles was enhanced nearly four-fold (-35.559 kcal mol-1) at {101} facets via nitrogen doping{,} which indeed amplified the Au nanoparticle density on nitrided TiO2. The Au coated nitrogen doped TiO2 (N-TiO2-Au) hybrid electrodes show higher absorbance owing to the light scattering effect of Au nanoparticles. In addition{,} N-TiO2-Au hybrid electrodes block the charge leakage from the electrode to the electrolyte and thus reduce the charge recombination at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Despite the beneficial band narrowing effect of nitrogen in TiO2 on the electrochemical and visible light activity in N-TiO2-Au hybrid electrodes{,} it results in low photocurrent generation at higher Au NP loading (3.4 [times] 10-7 M) due to light blocking the N-TiO2 surface. Strikingly{,} even with a ten-fold lower Au NP loading (0.34 [times] 10-7 M){,} the synergistic effects of nitrogen doping and Au NPs on the N-TiO2-Au hybrid system yield high photocurrent compared to TiO2 and TiO2-Au electrodes. As a result{,} the N-TiO2-Au electrode produces nearly 270 [small mu ]mol h-1 cm-2 hydrogen{,} which is nearly two-fold higher than the pristine TiO2 counterpart. The implications of these findings for the design of efficient hybrid photoelectrocatalytic electrodes are discussed."}

abstract = "Fujishima and Honda (1972) demonstrated the potential of titanium dioxide (TiO2) semiconductor materials to split water into hydrogen and oxygen in a photo-electrochemical cell. Their work triggered the development of semiconductor photocatalysis for a wide range of environmental and energy applications. One of the most significant scientific and commercial advances to date has been the development of visible light active (VLA) TiO2 photocatalytic materials. In this review, a background on TiO2 structure, properties and electronic properties in photocatalysis is presented. The development of different strategies to modify TiO2 for the utilization of visible light, including non metal and/or metal doping, dye sensitization and coupling semiconductors are discussed. Emphasis is given to the origin of visible light absorption and the reactive oxygen species generated, deduced by physicochemical and photoelectrochemical methods. Various applications of \{VLA\} TiO2, in terms of environmental remediation and in particular water treatment, disinfection and air purification, are illustrated. Comprehensive studies on the photocatalytic degradation of contaminants of emerging concern, including endocrine disrupting compounds, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, cyanotoxins and volatile organic compounds, with \{VLA\} TiO2 are discussed and compared to conventional UV-activated TiO2 nanomaterials. Recent advances in bacterial disinfection using \{VLA\} TiO2 are also reviewed. Issues concerning test protocols for real visible light activity and photocatalytic efficiencies with different light sources have been highlighted. "

abstract = "Anatase TiO2 nanocrystallines (17–29 nm) were successfully synthesized by the metal–organic chemical vapor deposition method (MOCVD). Moderate manipulation of system parameters of \{MOCVD\} can control the particle size. The electro-optical and photocatalytic properties of the synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles were studied along with several commercially available ultra-fine TiO2 particles (e.g., 3.8–5.7 nm). The band gap of the TiO2 crystallines was determined using the transformed diffuse reflectance technique according to the Kubelka–Munk theory. Results showed that the band gap of TiO2 monotonically decreased from 3.239 to 3.173 eV when the particle size decreased from 29 to 17 nm and then increased from 3.173 to 3.289 eV as the particle size decreased from 17 to 3.8 nm. The results of band gap change as a function of particle size agreed well with what was predicted by the Brus’ equation, i.e., the effective mass model (EMM). However, results of the photocatalytic oxidation of 2-chlorophenol (2-CP), showed that the smaller the particle size, the faster the degradation rate. This is attributed in part to the combined effect of band gap change relative to the spectrum of the light source and the specific surface area (or particle size) of the photocatalysts. The change of band gap due to particle size represents only a small optical absorption window with respect to the total spectrum of the light source, i.e., from 380 to 400 nm versus &gt;280 nm. Consequently, the gain in optical property of the larger particles was severely compromised by their decrease in specific surface area. Our results clearly indicated the importance of specific surface area in controlling the photocatalytic reactivity of photocatalysts. Results also showed that the secondary particle size grew with time due mainly to particle aggregation. The photocatalytic rate constants decreased exponentially with increase in primary particle size. Primary particle size alone is able to predict the photocatalytic rate as it is closely related to the electro-optical properties of photocatalysts. "

abstract="In the present study, we show that silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with different shape, aggregation state and color (violet, green, orange) have been successfully incorporated into polyelectrolyte multilayer thin films using the layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly. In order to obtain colored thin films based on AgNPs is necessary to maintain the aggregation state of the nanoparticles, a non-trivial aspect in which this work is focused on. The use of Poly(acrylic acid, sodium salt) (PAA) as a protective agent of the AgNPs is the key element to preserve the aggregation state and makes possible the presence of similar aggregates (shape and size) within the LbLcolored films. This approach based on electrostatic interactions of the polymeric chains and the immobilization of AgNPs with different shape and size into the thin films opens up a new interesting perspective to fabricate multicolornanocomposites based on AgNPs.",

abstract = {We present models for the optical functions of 11 metals used asmirrors and contacts in optoelectronic and optical devices: noblemetals (Ag, Au, Cu), aluminum, beryllium, and transition metals(Cr, Ni, Pd, Pt, Ti, W). We used two simple phenomenologicalmodels, the Lorentz--Drude (LD) and the Brendel--Bormann (BB),to interpret both the free-electron and the interband parts of thedielectric response of metals in a wide spectral range from 0.1 to 6eV. Our results show that the BB model was needed to describeappropriately the interband absorption in noble metals, while for Al,Be, and the transition metals both models exhibit good agreement withthe experimental data. A comparison with measurements on surfacenormal structures confirmed that the reflectance and the phase changeon reflection from semiconductor--metal interfaces (including thecase of metallic multilayers) can be accurately described by use ofthe proposed models for the optical functions of metallic films and thematrix method for multilayer calculations.},
